## 4 Differences between the implementation and the paper.

There are several differences between the Aleph as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05156) and the version implemented in AlephBFT. Many of them are already described in previous sections but for completeness we briefly list the differences here.

1. The main version of Aleph uses Reliable Broadcast to disseminate units. The AlephBFT implementation is closer to QuickAleph (in the Appendix of the paper) that uses Reliable Broadcast only for Alerts.
2. The specifics of alerts are different in the AlephBFT implementation -- in particular they do not require to freeze the protocol at any moment and are generally simpler.
3. AlephBFT uses its own variant of Reliable Broadcast -- see the section [Reliable Broadcast](reliable_broadcast.md##reliable-broadcast).
4. Differences in the use of randomness -- see [Randomness in AlephBFT](how_alephbft_does_it.md#24-randomness-in-alephbft).
5. The main version in the paper uses a full list of parent hashes instead of control hashes -- the latter is described in the Appendix as an optimization.
6. The paper's Appendix proposes the use of random gossip as a method of disseminating units -- AlephBFT uses repeated broadcast + a request/response mechanism instead, which according to our experience performs much better in practice.
